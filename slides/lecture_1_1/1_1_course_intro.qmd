## Syllabus review {background-color="orange"}

- Let's take a look together



# Why computational methods?



## Why do we need computational methods?

Most things you've done so far have likely been solvable analytically

Including OLS: $\hat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1}X'Y$

. . .

**Not all economic models have closed-form solutions, and others can't have closed-form solutions with losing important economic content**



## What can we compute?

We can use computation + theory to answer **quantitative** questions

. . .

Theory can't give us welfare in dollar terms

Theory can't tell us the value of economic primitives




## What can we compute?

Theory often relies on strong assumptions like:

. . .

- log utility (income loss vs substitution)
- no transaction costs (important friction)
- strictly concave objectives (natural phenomena don't usually follow this)
- static decision-making

It can be unclear what the costs of these assumptions are



# Some apparently simple questions


## Example 1

Suppose we have a constant elasticity demand function: 

$$q(p) = p^{-0.2}$$

In equilibrium, quantity demanded is $q^* = 2$

**Q: What price clears the market in equilibrium?**



## Example 1

A: Just invert the demand function

$$2 = p^{-0.2}$$

. . .

$$p^* = 2^{-5} \checkmark$$

Your calculator can do the rest



## Example 2

Suppose the demand function is now

$$q(p) = 0.5p^{-0.2} + 0.5p^{-0.5},$$

a weighted average of two CE demand functions

In equilibrium, quantity demanded is $q^* = 2$

**Q: What price clears the market in equilibrium?**

. . .

First, does a solution exist?

. . .

Yes, why?



## Example 2

$q(p)$ is continuous and monotonically decreasing

. . .

$q(p)$ is greater than 2 at $p=0.1$ and less than 2 at $p=0.2$

. . .

$\Rightarrow$ by intermediate value theorem $q(p) = 2$ somewhere in $(0.1,0.2)$



## Example 2

```{julia}
#| echo: TRUE
#| label: example2_setup
# We know solution is between .1 and .2
x = collect(range(.1, stop = .2, length = 10)); # generate evenly spaced grid
q_d = ones(size(x)).*2; # generate equal length vector of qd=2

# Define price function
price(p) = p.^(-0.2)/2 .+ p.^(-0.5)/2;

# Get corresponding quantity values at these prices
y = price(x);
```

Now plot $q_d$ and $q(p)$

```julia
using Plots;
plot(x, [y q_d],
    linestyle = [:solid :dot],
    linewidth = [3 3],
    linecolor = [:red :blue],
    tickfontsize = 12,
    grid = :no,
    xlabel = "p",
    ylabel = "q(p)",
    label = ["q(p)" "Quantity Demanded"])
```

## Example 2

```{julia}
#| label: example2_plot
#| fig-cap: "A solution exist!"
using Plots;
plot(x, [y q_d],
    linestyle = [:solid :dot],
    linewidth = [3 3],
    linecolor = [:red :blue],
    tickfontsize = 12,
    grid = :no,
    xlabel = "p",
    ylabel = "q(p)",
    label = ["q(p)" "Quantity Demanded"])
```




## Example 2

Notice: if we let $t = p^{-0.1}$ then

$$q(t) = 0.5t^2 + 0.5t^5$$

. . .

Can we solve for $t$ now?

. . .

No! Closed-form solutions to fifth order polynomials are not guaranteed to exist!

. . .

So how do we solve the problem?



## Newton's method

Iteratively do the following:

1. Guess solution to: $q(p) - q^* = 0 \Rightarrow q(p) - 2 = 0$
2. Approximate the function with local 2nd-order polynomial around guess
3. Solve this easier equation
4. Solution is the new guess
5. Stop if previous guess and new guess are sufficiently close

We will learn more about this and why it works in a later class



## Coding Newton's method

```{julia}
#| echo: TRUE
#| label: example2_function_def
# Define demand functions
demand(p) = p^(-0.2)/2 + p^(-0.5)/2 - 2;     # demanded quantity minus target
demand_grad(p) = .1*p^(-1.2) + .25*p^(-1.5); # demand gradient
```

. . .

```{julia}
#| echo: TRUE
#| label: example2_function_newton
function find_root_newton(demand, demand_grad)
    p = .3        # initial guess
    deltap = 1e10 # initialize stepsize

    while abs(deltap) > 1e-4
        deltap = demand(p)/demand_grad(p)
        p += deltap
        println("Intermediate guess of p = $(round(p,digits=3)).")
    end
    println("The solution is p = $(round(p,digits=3)).")
    return p
end;
```



## Newton code

```{julia}
#| echo: TRUE
#| label: example2_solution
# Solve for price
find_root_newton(demand, demand_grad)
```



## Example 3

Consider a two period ag commodity market model

- Period 1: Farmer makes acreage decisions for planting  
- Period 2: Per-acre yield realizes, equilibrium crop price clears the market

. . .

The farmer's policy function is: 

$$a(E[p]) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}E[p]$$



## Example 3

Yield $\hat{y}$ is stochastic and only realized after planting period. It follows $\hat{y} \sim \mathcal{N}(1, 0.1)$


Crop production is 

$$q = a\hat{y}$$

. . .

Demand is given by 

$$p(q) = 3-2q$$

. . .

**Q: How many acres get planted?**



## Example 3

**Q: How many acres get planted?**

A: We plug in the stochastic quantity and take expectations

$p(\hat{y}) = 3-2a\hat{y}$

. . .

$a = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}(3-2aE[\hat{y}])$

. . .

Rearrange and solve:

$a^* = 1$



## Example 3

Now suppose the government implements a price floor such that $p \geq 1$. 

We now have that 

$$p(\hat{y}) = \max(1,3-2a\hat{y})$$

**Q: How many acres get planted with a price floor?**



## Example 3

**Q: How many acres get planted with a price floor?**

This is analytically intractable

. . .

The max operator is non-linear so we can't pass the expectation through

$E[\max(1,3-2a\hat{y})] \neq \max(1,E[3-2a\hat{y}])$

. . .

**We need to solve this numerically**



## Function iteration

We can solve this using **Monte Carlo integration** and **function iteration**

```{julia}
#| echo: TRUE
#| label: example3_root_finding
using Statistics
# Function iteration method to find a root
function find_root_fi(mn, variance)

    y = randn(1000)*sqrt(variance) .+ mn # draws of the random variable
    a = 1.                               # initial guess
    differ = 100.                        # initialize error
    exp_price = 1.                       # initialize expected price

    while differ > 1e-4
        a_old = a                      # save old acreage
        p = max.(1, 3 .- 2 .*a.*y)     # compute price at all distribution points
        exp_price = mean(p)            # compute expected price
        a = 1/2 + 1/2*exp_price        # get new acreage planted given new price
        differ= abs(a - a_old)         # change in acreage planted
        println("Intermediate acreage guess: $(round(a,digits=3))")
    end

    return a, exp_price
end;
```



## Function iteration

```{julia}
#| echo: TRUE
#| label: example3_solution
acreage, expected_price = find_root_fi(1, 0.1);
println("The optimal number of acres to plant is $(round(acreage, digits = 3)).\nThe expected price is $(round(expected_price, digits = 3)).")
```
