- Today we will learn how to calculate integrals
- Just like derivatives, integrals rely on infinitesimal concepts that the computer cannot represent, so approximations will be required
- We will also rely on packages to help us automate the difficult parts

-   Lecture notes for Ivan Rudik's *Dynamic Optimization* (Cornell) 



## Numerical integration

First thing: integration is trickier than differentiation

. . .

We need to do integration for many things in economics

. . .

- Calculating expectations 
  - $E[g(x)] = \int_S g(x)dP(x), \; g: S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, \; P$ is the probability measure on measurable space $S$

. . .

- Adding up a continuous measure of things
  - $\int_D f(x) dx, \; f:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, \; D\subset\mathcal{R}^n$ 



## How to think about integrals

Integrals are effectively infinite sums

. . .

1-dimensional example:

$$\lim_{dx_i\rightarrow0}\sum_{i=0}^{(a-b)/dx_i} f(x_i) dx_i$$

where

- $dx_i$ is the lenght of some subset of $[a,b]$
- $x_i$ is some evaluation point (e.g. midpoint of $dx_i$)



## Infinite limits strike again

Just like derivatives, we face an infinite limit because as ${dx_i} \rightarrow 0$, $\frac{(a-b)}{dx_i} \rightarrow \infty$

. . .

We avoid this issue in the same way as derivatives: **we replace the infinite sum with something we can handle**

. . .

We will see two types of methods:

1. Stochastic approximation with Monte Carlo
2. Quadrature



## Monte Carlo integration

It's probably the most commonly used form in empirical economics

. . .

**Key idea**: *approximate an integral by relying on LLN and "randomly"* **sampling the integration domain**

. . .

- Can be effective for very-high-dimensional integrals
- Very simple and intuitive
- But produces a *random approximation*



## Monte Carlo integration

We integrate 
$$
\xi = \int_0^1 f(x) dx
$$

by drawing $N$ uniform samples, $x_1,\dots,x_N$ over interval $[0,1]$

. . .

- $\xi$ is equivalent to $E[f(x)]$ with respect to a uniform distribution, so estimating the integral is the same as estimating the expected value of $f(x)$

. . .

- In general we have that $\hat{\xi} = V\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i)$, where $V$ is the volume over which we are integrating

. . .

- LLN gives us that the $plim_{N\rightarrow\infty} \hat{\xi} = \xi$



## Monte Carlo integration

The variance of $\hat{\xi}$ is $$\sigma^2_{\hat{\xi}} = Var(\frac{V}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i)) = \frac{V^2}{N^2} \sum_{i=1}^N Var(f(X)) = \frac{V^2}{N}\sigma^2_{f(X)}$$

. . .

So average error is $\frac{V}{\sqrt{N}}\sigma_{f(X)}$. This gives us its rate of convergence: $O(1/\sqrt{N})$

Notes:

1. The rate of convergence is independent of the dimension of x
2. Quasi-Monte Carlo methods can get you $O(1/N)$
   - These methods have a smarter approach to sampling 
   - They use nonrandom sequences like so they cover the support in more efficient ways (see details on Ch 5.4 of Miranda and Fackler)



## Monte Carlo integration

Suppose we want to integrate $x^2$ from 0 to 10, we know this is $10^3/3 = 333.333$

```{julia}
# Package for drawing random numbers
using Distributions
# Define a function to do the integration for an arbitrary function
function integrate_mc(f, lower, upper, num_draws)
  # Draw from a uniform distribution
  xs = rand(Uniform(lower, upper), num_draws)
  # Expectation = mean(x)*volume
  expectation = mean(f(xs))*(upper - lower)
end
```



## Monte Carlo integration

Suppose we want to integrate $x^2$ from 0 to 10, we know this is $10^3/3 = 333.333$

```{julia}
f(x) = x.^2;
integrate_mc(f, 0, 10, 1000)
```

Quite close for a random process!



## Quadrature rules

We can also approximate integrals using a technique called **quadrature**

. . .

With quadrature we effectively take weighted sums to approximate integrals

. . .

We will focus on two classes of quadrature for now:

1. Newton-Cotes (the kind you've seen before)
2. Gaussian (probably new)



## Newton-Cotes quadrature rules

Suppose we want to integrate a one dimensional function $f(x)$ over $[a,b]$

How would you do it?

. . .

One answer is to replace the function with something easier to integrate: **a piece-wise polynomial**

. . .

Key things to define up front:

- $x_i = a + (i-1)/h$ for $i=1,2,...,n$ where $h = \frac{b-a}{n-1}$
  - $x_i$s are the **quadrature nodes** of the approximation scheme and divide the interval into $n-1$ evenly spaced subintervals of length $h$



## Midpoint rule

Most basic Newton-Cotes method:

1. Split $[a,b]$ into intervals
2. Approximate the function in each subinterval by a constant equal to the function at the midpoint of the subinterval


. . .

$$\int_{x_i}^{x_{i+1}} f(x) dx \approx hf(\frac{1}{2}(x_{i+1}+x_i))$$

. . .

Approximates $f$ by a step function



## Midpoint rule


![](figures/midpoint.drawio.svg){fig-align="center"}




## Midpoint rule: let's code it up

Let's integrate $x^2$ again from $0$ to $100$ (the answer is 333.33...)

```{julia}
# Generic function to integrate with midpoint
function integrate_midpoint(f, a, b, N)
    # Calculate h given the interval [a,b] and N nodes
    h = (b-a)/(N-1)
    
    # Calculate the nodes starting from a+h/2 til b-h/2
    x = collect(a+h/2:h:b-h/2)
    
    # Calculate the expectation    
    expectation = sum(h*f(x))
end;
```




## Midpoint rule: let's code it up

```{julia}
f(x) = x.^2;

println("Integrating with 5 nodes:$(integrate_midpoint(f, 0, 10, 5))")
println("Integrating with 50 nodes:$(integrate_midpoint(f, 0, 10, 50))")
println("Integrating with 100 nodes:$(integrate_midpoint(f, 0, 10, 100))")
```

. . .

Decent approximation with only 5 nodes. We get pretty close to the answer once we move up to 100 nodes.



## Trapezoid rule

Increase complexity by 1 degree:

1. Split $[a,b]$ into intervals
2. Approximate the function in each subinterval by a linear interpolation passing through $(x_i,f(x_i))$ and $(x_{i+1},f(x_{i+1}))$

. . .

$\int_{x_i}^{x_{i+1}} f(x) dx \approx \frac{h}{2}[f(x_i) + f(x_{i+1})]$

. . .

We can aggregate this up to

$$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx \approx \sum_{i=1}^n w_i f(x_i)$$

where $w_1=w_n = h/2$ and $w_i = h$ otherwise


## Trapezoid rule


![](figures/trapezoid.drawio.svg){fig-align="center"}



## How accurate is this rule?

Trapezoid rule is $O(h^2)$ and **first-order exact**: it can integrate any linear function exactly!



## Simpson's rule

Increase complexity by 1 degree:

Let $n$ be odd then approximate the function across a *pair of subintervals* by a quadratic interpolation passing through

- $(x_{i-1},f(x_{i-1}))$
- $(x_{i},f(x_{i}))$ and
- $(x_{i+1},f(x_{i+1}))$

. . .

$$
\int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_{i+1}} f(x) dx \approx \frac{h}{3}[f(x_{i-1}) + 4f(x_{i}) + f(x_{i+1})]
$$



## Simpson's rule

$\int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_{i+1}} f(x) dx \approx \frac{h}{3}[f(x_{i-1}) + 4f(x_{i}) + f(x_{i+1})]$

We can aggregate this by summing over *every two subintervals*

$$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx \approx \sum_{i=1}^n w_i f(x_i)$$

where $w_1=w_n = h/3$, otherwise and $w_i = 4h/3$ if $i$ is even and $w_i = 2h/3$ if $i$ is odd



## Simpson's rule


![](figures/simpson.png){fig-align="center"}


## How accurate is this rule?

Simpson's rule is $O(h^4)$ and **third-order exact**: it can integrate any cubic function exactly

. . .

That's weird! Why do we gain 2 orders of accuracy when increasing one order of approximation complexity?

. . .

1. The approximating piecewise quadratic is exact at the end points and midpoint of the conjoined two subintervals

. . .

2. The difference between a cubic $f(x)$ and the quadratic approximation in $[x_{2i-1},x_{2i+1}]$ is another cubic function

. . .

3. This cubic function is *odd* with respect to the midpoint $\rightarrow$ integrating over the first subinterval cancels integrating over the second subinterval



## Note on accuracy

The derivation of the order of error terms is similar to what we did for forward differences: we use Taylor expansions

But there are some extra steps because we have to bring the integral in. We're going to skip these derivations

**BUT** it is important to know that these derivations *assume smooth functions*. That might not be the case in economic models because corner solutions might exist!

- Simpson's is more accurate than the trapezoid rule for smooth functions
- But for functions with kinks/discontinuities in the 1st derivative, the trapezoid rule is often more accurate than Simpson's




## Higher order integration

We can generalize the unidimensional Newton-Cotes quadrature with tensor products

. . .

Suppose we want to integrate over a rectangle 

$$
\{(x_1, x_2) | a_1 \leq x_1 \leq b_1, a_2 \leq x_2 \leq b_2\} \in \mathbb{R}^2
$$

. . .

We compute separately the $n_1$ nodes and weights $(x_{1i}, w_{1i})$ and $n_2$ for $(x_{2j}, w_{2j})$. The tensor product will give us a grid with $n = n_1 n_2$ points

. . .

$$
\int_{a_1}^{b_1} \int_{a_2}^{b_2} f(x_1, x_2) dx_2 dx_1  \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n_1} \sum_{j=1}^{n_2} w_{1i} w_{2j} f(x_{1i}, x_{2j})
$$

. . .

We can use the same idea for 3+ dimensions. But the number of points increases very quickly: **curse of dimensionality**





## Gaussian quadrature rules

How did we pick the $x_i$ quadrature nodes for Newton-Cotes rules?

. . .

Evenly spaced, but no particular reason for doing so...

. . .

Gaussian quadrature selects these nodes more efficiently and relies on **weight functions** $w(x)$



## Gaussian quadrature rules

Gaussian rules try to **exactly integrate** some finite dimensional collection of functions (i.e. polynomials up to some degree)

. . .

For a given order of approximation $n$, the weights $w_1,...,w_n$ and nodes $x_1,...,x_n$ are chosen to satisfy $2n$ **moment matching conditions**:

. . .

$$
\int_I x^kw(x)dx = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i x^k_i, \;\text{for}\; k=0,...,2n-1
$$

where $I$ is the interval over which we are integrating and $w(x)$ is a given weight function



## Gaussian quadrature improves accuracy

The moment matching conditions pin down $w_i$s and $x_i$s so we can approximate an integral by a weighted sum of the function at the prescribed nodes

. . .

$$
\int_i f(x) w(x)dx \approx \sum_{i=1}^n w_i f(x_i)
$$

. . .

Gaussian rules are $2n-1$ order exact: we can exactly compute the integral of any polynomial order $2n-1$



## Gaussian quadrature takeaways

Gaussian quadrature effectively discretizes some distribution $p(x)$
into mass points (nodes) and probabilities (weights) for some other discrete distribution $\bar{p}(x)$

. . .

- Given an approximation with $n$ mass points, $X$ and $\bar{X}$ have identical moments up to order $2n$
- As $n\rightarrow\infty$ we have a continuum of mass points and recover the continuous pdf

. . .

But what do we pick for the weighting function $w(x)$?



## Gauss-Legendre

We can start out with a simple $w(x) = 1$: this gives us **Gauss-Legendre** quadrature

This can approximate the integral of any function arbitrarily well by increasing $n$



## Gauss-Laguerre

Sometimes we want to compute exponentially discounted sums like

$$
\int_I f(x) e^{-x} dx
$$

The weighting function $e^{-x}$ is **Gauss-Laguerre quadrature**

. . .

- In economics, this method is particularly suited for applications with continuous-time discounting



## Gauss-Hermite

Sometimes we want to take expectations of functions of normally distributed variables

$$
\int_I f(x) e^{-x^2} dx
$$

. . .

- Other methods exist for specialized functional forms/distributions: gamma, beta, chi-square, etc 


## Gaussian quadrature nodes and weights

*OK, Gaussian quadrature sounds nice. But how do we actually find the nodes and weights?*

. . .

It's a non-trivial task: we have to solve $2n$ nonlinear equations to get $n$ pairs $(x_i, w_n)$


We'll use a package for that: `QuantEcon.jl`

- *(QuantEcon functions are also implemented in Python: [QuantEconPy](https://quantecon.org/quantecon-py/))*
- Another package `FastGaussQuadrature.jl` does a better job with high-order integrals or weights with singularities 
- `QuadGK` has methods to improve precision further with adaptive subdomains




## `QuantEcon.jl`: Gaussian quadrature

Let's go back to our previous example and integrate $x^2$ from $0$ to $10$ again (the answer is 333.333...)

```{julia}
using QuantEcon;
# Our generic function to integrate with Gaussian quadrature
function integrate_gauss(f, a, b, N)
    # This function get nodes and weights for Gauss-Legendre quadrature
    x, w = qnwlege(N, a, b)

    # Calculate expectation
    expectation = sum(w .* f(x))
end;
```




## `QuantEcon.jl`: Gaussian quadrature


```{julia}
f(x) = x.^2;
println("Integrating with 1 node:$(integrate_gauss(f, 0, 10, 1))")
println("Integrating with 2 nodes:$(integrate_gauss(f, 0, 10, 2))")
```

. . .

All we needed was 2 nodes!

- We need 1000 draws with Monte Carlo and 100 nodes with midpoint to get limited approximations



## `QuantEcon.jl`: Other quadratures

`QuantEcon.jl` has a lot more to offer^[Check out the [documentation](http://quantecon.github.io/QuantEcon.jl/latest/api/QuantEcon.html)]

- Trapezoid (`qnwtrap`) and Simpson's (`qnwsimp`) rule
- Gauss-Hermite (`qnwnorm`) or Gaussian with any continuous distribution (`qnwdist`)
- Generic quadrature integration (`quadrect`)


## Practice integration with `QuantEcon.jl`

Let's integrate $f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2 + 1}$ from 0 to 1

Tip: Type `?` in the REPL and the name of the function to read its documentation and learn how to call it


1. Use `quadrect` to integrate using Monte Carlo
  - You will need to code your function `f` to accept an array (`.` syntax)
2. Use `qnwtrap` to integrate using the Trapezoid rule quadrature
3. Use `qnwlege` to integrate using Gaussian quadrature

. . .

Do we know what is the analytic solution to this integral?


## Practice integration with `QuantEcon.jl`


```{julia}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
f(x) = 1.0./(x.^2 .+ 1.0);
# 1. Use `quadrect` to integrate using Monte Carlo with 1000 nodes
quadrect(f, 1000, 0.0, 1.0, "R")
```
```{julia}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
# 2. Use `qnwtrap` to integrate using the Trapezoid rule quadrature with 7 nodes
x, w = qnwtrap(7, 0.0, 1.0);
# Perform quadrature approximation
sum(w .* f(x))
```
```{julia}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
# 3. Use `qnwlege` to integrate using Gaussian quadrature with 7 nodes
x, w = qnwlege(7, 0.0, 1.0);
# Perform quadrature approximation
sum(w .* f(x))
```

. . .

By the way, $\int^1_0 1/(x^2 + 1) = \arctan(1) = \pi/4$
```{julia}
π/4
```
